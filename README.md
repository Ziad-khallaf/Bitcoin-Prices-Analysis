This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin (BTC) price movements against the US Dollar (USD) from September 2015 to September 2021. The project combines interactive Power BI dashboards with a detailed Python-based analysis in a Jupyter Notebook to provide insights into Bitcoin's historical performance, risk, and market trends.

This project presents a complete analysis of Bitcoin price behavior over a six-year period. The objective is to:
- Clean and explore a large financial dataset.
- Engineer new financial features like **daily return** and **volatility**.
- Identify trends, patterns, and outliers.
- Evaluate investment potential and simulate ROI.

The insights are supported by rich **visualizations** in both Python and **interactive dashboards in Power BI**.


## Overview

This project aims to provide a multi-faceted understanding of Bitcoin's price dynamics, catering to a range of audiences from investors and analysts to executives seeking a high-level overview.  It includes:

* **Interactive Power BI Dashboards:** Visualizations of key performance indicators (KPIs) and historical price trends.
* **Detailed Jupyter Notebook Analysis:** A step-by-step walkthrough of the data analysis process using Python, including data handling, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Project Components

* **Power BI Dashboards:**
    * **Dashboard 1: Key Metrics & Performance ("Home")**
        * Provides a high-level overview of Bitcoin's performance with key KPIs:
            * Highest Price
            * Lowest Price
            * Average Price
            * Average Volume
            * Return on Investment (ROI)
            * Annualized ROI
            * Annualized Volatility
            * Maximum Drawdown
        * Visualizations of volatility by year and distribution of daily returns.
    * **Dashboard 2: Historical Trends ("Insights")**
        * Presents a broader historical perspective:
            * Bitcoin prices over time.
            * Average price trends.
            * Highest and lowest historical prices.
            * Average trading volume.
    * **Jupyter Notebook (`Bitcoin_Prices`):** Contains the Python code and analysis used to:
        * Load and clean the Bitcoin price data.
        * Calculate relevant features (e.g., daily returns, volatility).
        * Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
        * Make ROI Calculator (ROI Simulation).
        * Calculate DAX measures for use in Power BI.
        * Develop a Bitcoin investment calculator.

## Jupyter Notebook Analysis

The Jupyter Notebook (`Bitcoin_Prices.pdf`) provides a detailed, code-driven analysis of the Bitcoin price data. It covers the following:

* **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Loading the data from a CSV file and handling any missing values or data inconsistencies.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features, such as daily returns and volatility, from the raw price data.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and analyzing the data to understand its key characteristics, including price trends, distributions, and relationships between variables.
* **DAX Measure Calculations:** Python code used to calculate metrics that are then implemented as DAX measures in the Power BI dashboards.
* **Bitcoin Investment Calculator:** A Python-based tool to calculate investment performance metrics (ROI, Annualized ROI) based on user-specified purchase and sell dates.

You can view the notebook in the `Bitcoin_Prices.pdf` file.

## üìà Key Findings
